This project unifies the xv6 source and the xv6 book into a
side-by-side format with the goal of reducing the cost of context
switches, or in the parlance of curriculum science: extranious load.

more on that in the paper [[https://openlearning.mit.edu/sites/default/files/CognitiveScienceOf%20Learning-ConceptsAndStrategiesForTheEducatoR%20AndLearner.PDF][The Cognitive Science of Learning: Concepts and
Strategies for the Educator and Learner]].

xv6-explora also supports fine grained, sentence-by-sentence
text-to-speech with keyboard controls utilizing html5 built-in voice
for low latency.  


** Why u no troff?
I like troff. The xv6-book is written in troff, whereas this project
is using jinja2 templates with python. It would have been WAAYYYY
easier to just use troff, so why the switch away from troff?

Paragraph tags. That's it. I started building a separate set of troff
macros but couldn't figure out how to reliable capture paragraphs with
the .PP macro.  Paragraphs need to be unambiguous for the screen
reader to split on sentences.
