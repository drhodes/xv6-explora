This project unifies the xv6 source and the xv6 book into a
side-by-side format with the goal of reducing the cost of context
switches, or in the parlance of curriculum science: extranious load.

more on that in the paper [[https://openlearning.mit.edu/sites/default/files/CognitiveScienceOf%20Learning-ConceptsAndStrategiesForTheEducatoR%20AndLearner.PDF][The Cognitive Science of Learning: Concepts and
Strategies for the Educator and Learner]].

xv6-explora also supports fine grained, sentence-by-sentence
text-to-speech with keyboard controls utilizing html5 built-in voice
for low latency.
