  {{ "Operating System Interfaces" | chapter }}
  <p>
    The job of an operating system is to share a computer among multiple programs
    and to provide a more useful set of services than the hardware alone supports. The
    operating system manages and abstracts the low-level hardware, so that, for example, a
    word processor need not concern itself with which type of disk hardware is being
    used. It also shares the hardware among multiple programs so that they run (or appear
    to run) at the same time. Finally, operating systems provide controlled ways for
    programs to interact, so that they can share data or work together. </p>          
  <p>
    An operating system provides services to user programs through an
    interface.  Designing a good interface turns out to be difficult. On
    the one hand, we would like the interface to be simple and narrow
    because that makes it easier to get the implementation right. On the
    other hand, we may be tempted to offer many sophisticated features to
    applications. The trick in resolving this tension is to design
    interfaces that rely on a few mechanisms that can be combined to
    provide much generality. </p>          
  <p>  
    This book uses a single operating system as a concrete example to illustrate operating
    system concepts. That operating system, xv6, provides the basic interfaces introduced
    by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie’s Unix operating system, as well as mimicking
    Unix’s internal design. Unix provides a narrow interface whose mechanisms
    combine well, offering a surprising degree of generality. This interface has been so
    successful that modern operating systems—BSD, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, and even,
    to a lesser extent, Microsoft Windows—have Unix-like interfaces. Understanding xv6
    is a good start toward understanding any of these systems and many others. </p>
  

  {{ "figure 0-1" | figure("0-1-dar") }}
  <br>
  
  <p>
    As shown in Figure 0-1, xv6 takes the traditional form of a kernel, a special program
    that provides services to running programs. Each running program, called a process,
    has memory containing instructions, data, and a stack. The instructions implement
    the program’s computation. The data are the variables on which the computation
    acts. The stack organizes the program’s procedure calls. </p>
  
  <p>
    When a process needs to invoke a kernel service, it invokes a procedure call in
    the operating system interface. Such a procedure is called a system call. The system
    call enters the kernel; the kernel performs the service and returns. Thus a process alternates
    between executing in user space and kernel space. </p>
  
  <p>
    The kernel uses the CPU’s hardware protection mechanisms
    to ensure that each process executing in user space can
    access only its own memory. The kernel executes with the
    hardware privileges required to implement these
    protections; user programs execute without those
    privileges. When a user program invokes a system call, the
    hardware raises the privilege level and starts executing a
    pre-arranged function in the kernel. </p>
  
  <p>
    The collection of system calls that a kernel provides is
    the interface that user programs see. The xv6 kernel
    provides a subset of the services and system calls that
    Unix kernels traditionally offer. Figure 0-2 lists all of
    xv6’s system calls. </p>
  
  <p>
    The rest of this chapter outlines xv6’s
    services—processes, memory, file descriptors, pipes, and
    file system—and illustrates them with code snippets and
    discussions of how the shell, which is the primary user
    interface to traditional Unix-like systems, uses them. The
    shell’s use of system calls illustrates how carefully they
    have been designed.  The shell is an ordinary program that
    reads commands from the user and executes them. The fact
    that the shell is a user program, not part of the kernel,
    illustrates the power of the system call interface: there
    is nothing special about the shell. It also means that the
    shell is easy to replace; as a result, modern Unix systems
    have a variety of shells to choose from, each with its own
    user interface and scripting features. The xv6 shell is a
    simple implementation of the essence of the Unix Bourne
    shell. Its implementation can be found at line <a href="javascript:gotoLine(8550)">8550</a>.</p>

  {{ "Processes and memory" | section }}
  
  <p> An xv6 process consists of user-space memory
    (instructions, data, and stack) and per-process state
    private to the kernel. Xv6 can time-share processes: it
    transparently switches the available CPUs among the set of
    processes waiting to execute. When a process is not
    executing, xv6 saves its CPU registers, restoring them when
    it next runs the process. The kernel associates a process
    identifier, or pid, with each process.</p>
  
  <p>A process may create a new process using the {{ "fork" | goto_line }}  system
    call. Fork creates a new process, called the child process,
    with exactly the same memory contents as the calling
    process, called the parent process. Fork returns in both the
    parent and the child.  In the parent, fork returns the
    child’s pid; in the child, it returns zero. For example,
    consider the following program fragment: </p>
  
  {{
  '''        
  int pid = fork();
  
  if(pid > 0){
  printf("parent: child=%d\\n", pid);
  pid = wait();
  printf("child %d is done\\n", pid);
  } else if(pid == 0){
  printf("child: exiting\\n");
  exit();
  } else {
  printf("fork error\\n");
  }
  '''
  | code }}

  <p> The exit system call causes the calling process to stop
    executing and to release resources such as memory and open
    files. The wait system call returns the pid of an exited
    child of the current process; if none of the caller's
    children has exited, <code>wait</code> waits for one to do so. In the
    example, the output lines
  </p>

  <pre>
    parent: child=1234
    child: exiting
  </pre>
  
  <p> might come out in either order, depending on whether
    the parent or child gets to its printf call
    first. After the child exits the parent’s wait
    returns, causing the parent to print
  </p>

  <pre>
    parent: child 1234 is done
  </pre>

  <p>Although the child has the same memory contents as the
    parent initially, the parent and child are executing with
    different memory and different registers: changing a
    variable in one does not affect the other. For example,
    when the return value of wait is stored into pid in the
    parent process, it doesn’t change the variable pid in the
    child.  The value of pid in the child will still be zero.
    The <a href="javascript:gotoLine(6610);">exec</a> system call replaces the calling process’s memory
    with a new memory image loaded from a file stored in the
    file system. The file must have a particular format, which
    specifies which part of the file holds instructions, which
    part is data, at which instruction to start, etc. xv6 uses
    the ELF format, which Chapter 2 discusses in more
    detail. When  <a href="javascript:gotoLine(6610);">exec</a> succeeds, it does not return to the
    calling program; instead, the instructions loaded from the
    file start executing at the entry point declared in the
    ELF header.  <a href="javascript:gotoLine(6610);">exec</a> takes two arguments: the name of the file
    containing the executable and an array of string
    arguments. For example:
  </p>

  {{'''
  char *argv[3];
  argv[0] = "echo";
  argv[1] = "hello";
  argv[2] = 0;
  exec("/bin/echo", argv);
  printf("exec error\\n");
  ''' | code }}
  
  <p>
    This fragment replaces the calling program with an
    instance of the program /bin/echo running with the argument list echo
    hello. Most programs ignore the first argument, which is
    conventionally the name of the program.
  </p>

  <p>The xv6 shell uses the above calls to run programs on
    behalf of users. The main structure of the shell is simple; see main
    <a href="javascript:gotoLine(8701);">(8701)</a>. The main loop reads a line of input from the user with
    getcmd. Then it calls {{ "fork" | goto_line }} , which creates a copy of the shell process.
    The parent calls wait, while the child runs the command. For example,
    if the user had typed ‘‘echo hello’’ to the shell, runcmd would have
    been called with ‘‘echo hello’’ as the argument. runcmd <a href="javascript:gotoLine(8606);">(8606)</a> runs
    the actual command. For ‘‘echo hello’’, it would call exec <a href="javascript:gotoLine(8626);">(8626)</a>. If
    exec succeeds then the child will execute instructions from echo
    instead of runcmd. At some point echo will call exit, which will cause
    the parent to return from wait in main <a href="javascript:gotoLine(8701);">(8701)</a>. You might wonder why
    fork and exec are not combined in a single call; we will see later
    that separate calls for creating a process and loading a program is a
    clever design.</p>

  <p>
    Xv6 allocates most user-space memory implicitly: {{"fork"|goto_line}} 
    allocates the memory required for the child’s copy of the parent’s
    memory, and exec allocates enough memory to hold the executable
    file. A process that needs more memory at run-time (perhaps for
    malloc) can call sbrk(n) to grow its data memory by n bytes; sbrk
    returns the location of the new memory.</p>

  <p>Xv6 does not provide a notion of users or of protecting
    one user from another; in Unix terms, all xv6 processes run as root</p>

  <h4>I/O and File descriptors</h4>

  <p>A <i>file descriptor</i> is a small integer representing a
    kernel-managed object that a process may read from or write
    to. A process may obtain a file descriptor by opening a
    file, directory, or device, or by creating a pipe, or by
    duplicating an existing descriptor.  For simplicity we’ll
    often refer to the object a file descriptor refers to as a
    ‘‘file’’; the file descriptor interface abstracts away the
    differences between files, pipes, and devices, making them
    all look like streams of bytes.</p>

  <p>Internally, the xv6 kernel uses the file descriptor as an
    index into a per-process table, so that every process has a private
    space of file descriptors starting at zero. By convention, a process
    reads from file descriptor 0 (standard input), writes output to file
    descriptor 1 (standard output), and writes error messages to file
    descriptor 2 (standard error). As we will see, the shell exploits the
    convention to implement I/O redirection and pipelines. The shell
    ensures that it always has three file descriptors open <a href="javascript:gotoLine(8707);">(8707)</a>, which
    are by default file descriptors for the console.</p>
  <p>The read and write system calls read bytes from and write
    bytes to open files named by file descriptors. The
    call <code>read(fd, buf, n)</code> reads at most n bytes
    from the file descriptor fd, copies them into buf, and
    returns the number of bytes read. Each file descriptor
    that refers to a file has an offset associated with
    it. Read reads data from the current file offset and then
    advances that offset by the number of bytes read: a
    subsequent read will return the bytes following the ones
    returned by the first read.  When there are no more bytes
    to read, read returns zero to signal the end of the file.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The call <code>write(fd, buf, n)</code> writes n bytes from buf to the file descriptor fd and
    returns the number of bytes written. Fewer than n bytes are written only when an error
    occurs. Like read, write writes data at the current file offset and then advances
    that offset by the number of bytes written: each write picks up where the previous
    one left off.
  </p>
  
  <p> The following program fragment (which forms
    the essence of cat) copies data from its standard input to its
    standard output. If an error occurs, it writes a message to the
    standard error.</p>
  
  {{'''
  char buf[512];
  int n;
  for(;;) {
  n = read(0, buf, sizeof buf);
  if(n == 0)
  break;
  if(n < 0) {
         fprintf(2, "read error\\n");
         exit();
         }
         if(write(1, buf, n) != n){
         fprintf(2, "write error\\n");
         exit();
         }
         }
         ''' | code }}
         
         <p>The important thing to note in the code fragment is that cat doesn’t know whether it
           is reading from a file, console, or a pipe. Similarly cat doesn’t know whether it is
           printing to a console, a file, or whatever. The use of file descriptors and the convention
           that file descriptor 0 is input and file descriptor 1 is output allows a simple implementation
           of cat.</p>
  <p>The close system call releases a file descriptor, making it free for reuse by a future
    open, pipe, or dup system call (see below). A newly allocated file descriptor is always
    the lowest-numbered unused descriptor of the current process.</p>
  <p>File descriptors and fork interact to make I/O redirection easy to implement.
    Fork copies the parent’s file descriptor table along with its memory, so that the child
    starts with exactly the same open files as the parent. The system call exec replaces the
    calling process’s memory but preserves its file table. This behavior allows the shell to
    implement I/O redirection by forking, reopening chosen file descriptors, and then execing
    the new program. Here is a simplified version of the code a shell runs for the
    command cat &lt input.txt:</p>

  {{'''
  char *argv[2];

  argv[0] = "cat";
  argv[1] = 0;
  if(fork() == 0) {
  close(0);
  open("input.txt", O_RDONLY);
  exec("cat", argv);
  }
  '''|code}}
  <p>
    After the child closes file descriptor 0, open
    is guaranteed to use that file descriptor for
    the newly opened <code>input.txt</code>: 0
    will be the smallest available file
    descriptor. Cat then executes with file
    descriptor 0 (standard input) referring to <code>input.txt</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The code for I/O redirection in the xv6 shell
    works in exactly this way <a href="javascript:gotoLine(8630);">(8630)</a>.
    Recall that at this point in the code the
    shell has already forked the child shell and
    that runcmd will call exec to load the new
    program. Now it should be clear why it is a
    good idea that fork and exec are separate
    calls. Because if they are separate, the shell
    can fork a child, use open, close, dup in the
    child to change the standard input and output
    file descriptors, and then exec. No changes to
    the program being exec-ed (cat in our example)
    are required. If fork and exec were combined
    into a single system call, some other
    (probably more complex) scheme would be
    required for the shell to redirect standard
    input and output, or the program itself would
    have to understand how to redirect I/O.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although {{ "fork" | goto_line }}  copies the file descriptor
    table, each underlying file offset is shared
    between parent and child. Consider this
    example:
  </p>
  
  {{'''
  if(fork() == 0) {
  write(1, "hello ", 6);
  exit();
  } else {
  wait();
  write(1, "world\\n", 6);
  }
  '''|code}}
  
  <p>
    At the end of this fragment, the file attached
    to file descriptor 1 will contain the data hello world. The write in
    the parent (which, thanks to wait, runs only after the child is done)
    picks up where the child’s write left off. This behavior helps produce
    sequential output from sequences of shell commands, like
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    (echo hello; echo world) &gt output.txt
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    The <a href="javascript:gotoLine(6118);">dup</a> system call duplicates an existing
    file descriptor, returning a new one that refers to the same
    underlying I/O object. Both file descriptors share an offset, just as
    the file descriptors duplicated by {{ "fork" | goto_line }}  do. This is another way to
    write hello world into a file:
  </p>
  
  {{'''
  fd = dup(1);
  write(1, "hello ", 6);
  write(fd, "world\\n", 6);
  '''|code}}
  
  <p>
    Two file descriptors share an offset if they were derived from the
    same original file descriptor by a sequence of {{ "fork" | goto_line }}
    and dup calls. Otherwise file descriptors do not
    share offsets, even if they resulted from open calls for the same
    file. Dup allows shells to implement commands like this:
    <code>ls existing-file non-existing-file &gt tmp1
      2 &gt &1</code>. The <code>2 &gt &1</code> tells the shell to give
    the command a file descriptor 2 that is a duplicate of
    descriptor 1. Both the name of the existing file and the error
    message for the non-existing file will show up in the
    file <code>tmp1</code>. The xv6 shell doesn’t support I/O
    redirection for the error file descriptor, but now you know how
    to implement it.
  </p>
  <p>
    File descriptors are a powerful abstraction,
    because they hide the details of what they are
    connected to: a process writing to file
    descriptor 1 may be writing to a file, to a
    device like the console, or to a pipe.
  </p>


  {{ "Pipes" | section }}

  <p>
    A <a href="javascript:gotoLine(6551);">pipe</a> is a small kernel buffer exposed to
    processes as a pair of file descriptors,
    one for reading and one for
    writing. Writing data to one end of the
    pipe makes that data available for reading
    from the other end of the pipe. Pipes
    provide a way for processes to
    communicate.
  </p>

  <p>
    The following example code runs the program wc
    with standard input connected to the read end of a pipe.
  </p>

  {{'''
  int p[2];
  char *argv[2];

  argv[0] = "wc";
  argv[1] = 0;

  pipe(p);
  if(fork() == 0) {
  close(0);
  dup(p[0]);
  close(p[0]);
  close(p[1]);
  exec("/bin/wc", argv);
  } else {
  close(p[0]);
  write(p[1], "hello world\\n", 12);
  close(p[1]);
  }
  '''|code}}

  <p>
    The program calls pipe, which creates a new
    pipe and records the read and write file
    descriptors in the array p. After {{ "fork" | goto_line }}, both
    parent and child have file descriptors
    referring to the pipe. The child dups the read
    end onto file descriptor 0, closes the file
    descriptors in p, and execs wc. When wc reads
    from its standard input, it reads from the
    pipe. The parent closes the read side of the
    pipe, writes to the pipe, and then closes the
    write side.
  </p>

  <p>
    If no data is available, a on a pipe waits for
    either data to be written or all file descriptors
    referring to the write end to be closed; in the
    latter case, will return 0, just as if the end of
    a data file had been reached. The fact that blocks
    until it is impossible for new data to arrive is
    one reason that it's important for the child to
    close the write end of the pipe before executing
    above: if one of file descriptors referred to the
    write end of the pipe, would never see
    end-of-file.
  </p>
  <p>The xv6 shell implements pipelines such as</p>

  <code><pre> fork sh.c | wc -l </code></pre>                    

  <p>
    in a manner similar to the above code <a href="javascript:gotoLine(8650);">(8650)</a>. The child
    process creates a pipe to connect the left end of
    the pipeline with the right end. Then it calls and
    for the left end of the pipeline and and for the
    right end, and waits for both to finish. The right
    end of the pipeline may be a command that itself
    includes a pipe (e.g., which itself forks two new
    child processes (one for and one for Thus, the
    shell may create a tree of processes.  The leaves
    of this tree are commands and the interior nodes
    are processes that wait until the left and right
    children complete.  In principle, you could have
    the interior nodes run the left end of a pipeline,
    but doing so correctly would complicate the
    implementation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pipes may seem no more powerful than temporary
    files: the pipeline
  </p>

  <code><pre> echo hello world | wc </code></pre>


  <p>could be implemented without pipes as</p>

  <code><pre> echo hello world &gt /tmp/xyz; wc &lt /tmp/xyz </code></pre>

  <p>
    Pipes have at least four advantages over temporary
    files in this situation. First, pipes
    automatically clean themselves up; with the file
    redirection, a shell would have to be careful to
    remove <code>/tmp/xyz</code> when done. Second,
    pipes can pass arbitrarily long streams of data,
    while file redirection requires enough free space
    on disk to store all the data. Third, pipes allow
    for parallel execution of pipeline stages, while
    the file approach requires the first program to
    finish before the second starts. Fourth, if you
    are implementing inter-process communication,
    pipes' blocking reads and writes are more
    efficient than the non-blocking semantics of
    files.
  </p>

  {{ "File System" | section }}

  <p>
    The xv6 file system provides data files, which are
    uninterpreted byte arrays, and directories, which
    contain named references to data files and other
    directories. The directories form a tree, starting
    at a special directory called the root. A path
    like <code>/a/b/c</code> refers to the file or
    directory named <code>c</code> inside the
    directory named <code>b</code> inside the
    directory named <code>a</code> in the root
    directory
    <code>/</code>. Paths that don’t begin with <code>/</code>
    are evaluated relative to the calling process's
    current directory, which can be changed with the
    chdir system call. Both these code fragments open
    the same file (assuming all the directories
    involved exist):
  </p>

  {{'''
  chdir("/a");
  chdir("b");
  open("c", O_RDONLY);

  open("/a/b/c", O_RDONLY);
  '''| code}}


  <p>
    The first fragment changes the process’s current
    directory to /a/b; the second neither refers to
    nor changes the process’s current directory.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are multiple system calls to create a new
    file or directory: <a href="javascript:gotoLine(6451);">mkdir</a> creates
    a new directory, open with the <b>O_CREATE</b> flag
    creates a new data file, and <a href="javascript:gotoLine(6467);">mknod</a> creates a new
    device file. This example illustrates all three:
  </p>

  {{'''
  mkdir("/dir");
  fd = open("/dir/file", O_CREATE|O_WRONLY);
  close(fd);
  mknod("/console", 1, 1);
  ''' | code }}

  <p>
    Mknod creates a file in the file system, but the
    file has no contents. Instead, the file’s metadata
    marks it as a device file and records the major
    and minor device numbers (the two arguments to
    mknod), which uniquely identify a kernel
    device. When a process later opens the file, the
    kernel diverts read and write system calls to the
    kernel device implementation instead of passing
    them to the file system.  fstat retrieves
    information about the object a file descriptor
    refers to. It fills in a struct stat, defined in
    stat.h as:
  </p>

  {{'''
  #define T_DIR 1   // Directory
  #define T_FILE 2  // File
  #define T_DEV 3   // Device

  struct stat {
  short type;  // Type of file
  int dev;     // File system’s disk device
  uint ino;    // Inode
  number short nlink; // Number of links to file
  uint size;          // Size of file in bytes
  };
  '''|code}}

  <p> A file's name is distinct from the file
    itself; the same underlying file, called an
    <i>inode</i> , can have multiple names,
    called 
    .italic-index links .
    The
    <code>link</code>
    system call creates another file system name 
    referring to the same inode as an existing file.
    This fragment creates a new file named both
    <code>a</code>
    and
    <code>b</code> .
  </p>


  {{'''
  open("a", O_CREATE|O_WRONLY);
  link("a", "b");
  '''|code}}


  <p>
    Reading from or writing to
    <code>a</code> is the same as reading from or
    writing to <code>b</code>. Each inode is
    identified by a unique <i>inode number</i>.  After
    the code sequence above, it is possible to determine
    that <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> refer to the
    same underlying contents by inspecting the result of
    <code>fstat</code>: both will return the same inode number 
    <code>(ino),</code> and the <code>nlink</code> count
    will be set to 2.

  <p>
    The <code>unlink</code> system call removes a name
    from the file system.  The file's inode and the disk
    space holding its content are only freed when the
    file's link count is zero and no file descriptors
    refer to it. Thus adding
  </p>

  <code><pre>
      unlink("a");
  </code></pre>                   
  
  <p> to the last code sequence leaves the inode and
    file content accessible as <code>b</code> .
    Furthermore,
  </p>
  
  {{'''
  fd = open("/tmp/xyz", O_CREATE|O_RDWR);
  unlink("/tmp/xyz");
  '''|code}}
  
  <p>
    is an idiomatic way to create a temporary inode 
    that will be cleaned up when the process closes 
    <code>fd</code>
    or exits.
  </p>

  <p>
    Shell commands for file system operations are
    implemented as user-level programs such as
    <code>mkdir</code>, <code>ln</code>, <code>rm</code>,
    etc. This design allows anyone to extend the shell
    with new user commands by just adding a new
    user-level program.  In hindsight this plan seems
    obvious, but other systems designed at the time of
    Unix often built such commands into the shell (and
    built the shell into the kernel).
  </p>

  <p>
    One exception is <code>cd</code>, which is built into the shell {{
    8716 | line }} <code>cd</code> must change the current working
    directory of the shell itself.  If <code>cd</code> were run as a
    regular command, then the shell would fork a child process, the
    child process would run <code>cd</code>, and <code>cd</code> would
    change the <i>child's</i> working directory. The parent's (i.e., the
    shell's) working directory would not change.

  {{ "Real world" |section}}</h4>

<p>
  Unix's combination of the "standard" file
  descriptors, pipes, and convenient shell syntax for
  operations on them was a major advance in writing
  general-purpose reusable programs.
  The idea sparked a whole culture of "software tools" that was
  responsible for much of Unix's power and popularity,
  and the shell was the first so-called "scripting language."
  The Unix system call interface persists today in systems like
  BSD, Linux, and Mac OS X.
</p>

<p>
  The Unix system call interface has been standardized through the Portable
  Operating System Interface (POSIX) standard. Xv6 is <i>not</i>
  POSIX compliant.  It misses system calls (including basic ones such as
  <code>lseek</code>), it implements systems calls
  only partially, etc.  Our main goals for xv6 are
  simplicity and clarity while providing a simple
  UNIX-like system-call interface.  Several people
  have extended xv6 with a few more basic system calls
  and a simple C library so that they can run basic
  Unix programs.  Modern kernels, however, provide
  many more system calls, and many more kinds of
  kernel services, than xv6.  For example, they
  support networking, windowing systems, user-level
  threads, drivers for many devices, and so on.
  Modern kernels evolve continuously and rapidly, and
  offer many features beyond POSIX.
</p>

<p>
  For the most part, modern Unix-derived operating
  systems have not followed the early Unix model of
  exposing devices as special files, like the
  <code>console</code> device file discussed above.
  The authors of Unix went on to build Plan 9, which
  applied the "resources are files" concept to modern
  facilities, representing networks, graphics, and
  other resources as files or file trees.
</p>

<p>
  The file system abstraction has been a powerful
  idea. Even so, there are other models for operating
  system interfaces.  Multics, a predecessor of Unix,
  abstracted file storage in a way that made it look
  like memory, producing a very different flavor of
  interface. The complexity of the Multics design had
  a direct influence on the designers of Unix, who
  tried to build something simpler.
</p>

<p>
  This book examines how xv6 implements its Unix-like
  interface, but the ideas and concepts apply to more
  than just Unix. Any operating system must multiplex
  processes onto the underlying hardware, isolate
  processes from each other, and provide mechanisms
  for controlled inter-process communication.  After
  studying xv6, you should be able to look at other,
  more complex operating systems and see the concepts
  underlying xv6 in those systems as well.
